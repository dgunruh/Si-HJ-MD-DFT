# Methods used to merge the pure a-Si structures with c-Si structures
## This method places the a-Si a distance of a_0/4 away from the c-Si (two interfaces due to periodic boundary conditions), then anneals the interface
## All data was scrubbed to minimize repo space. Sample visualizations are here.
