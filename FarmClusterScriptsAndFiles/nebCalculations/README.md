# NEB Calculations
## Two methods were tried: LAMMPS MD, and QE DFT
### LAMMPS MD is the method we used
## Refer to the folders inputs/ and LAMMPS_neb/ for most of the relevant scripts. All data is kept elsewhere to minimize space on the repo
### Also see the folder energySpectraComparison for an examination of atom-by-atom excess energies
