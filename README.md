# Si-HJ MD-DFT
## The current work can be found in the following subdirectories:
- FarmClusterScriptsandFiles (containing scripts and some results from performing blast heating, creating heterostructures, and nudged elastic band calculations)
- NERSC (contains scripts used to create a-Si on the NERSC supercomputing cluster)
- Structure Analysis Scripts

## Other interesting archival data can be found in the following subdirectories:
- DFT Sample Merge
- GAP a-Si

## Finally, assorted historical scripts and potential files are contained here as well
